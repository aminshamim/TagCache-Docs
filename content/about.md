# About TagCache

TagCache is a lightning-fast, tag-aware in-memory cache server written in Rust, designed to deliver exceptional performance while maintaining simplicity and reliability.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to provide a high-performance caching solution that bridges the gap between simple key-value stores and complex distributed caching systems. TagCache offers enterprise-grade features while remaining easy to deploy and manage.

## Key Principles

### Performance First
Built with Rust for maximum performance and memory safety. Every component is optimized for speed, from the multi-shard architecture to the binary TCP protocol.

### Developer Experience
Simple APIs, comprehensive documentation, and intuitive tooling make TagCache easy to integrate into any application stack.

### Production Ready
Authentication, monitoring, health checks, and deployment tools ensure TagCache is ready for production environments from day one.

### Open Source
TagCache is open source under the MIT license, encouraging community contributions and transparency.

## Architecture

TagCache employs a sophisticated multi-shard architecture that maximizes concurrency while minimizing lock contention:

- **Sharded Storage**: Data is distributed across multiple shards using consistent hashing
- **Lock-free Operations**: DashMap provides concurrent access without traditional locking
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized data structures minimize memory overhead
- **Tag Management**: Efficient indexing enables fast tag-based operations

## Technology Stack

- **Core Language**: Rust for performance and memory safety
- **HTTP Server**: Axum for high-performance web APIs
- **Concurrent HashMap**: DashMap for lock-free concurrent access
- **Serialization**: Serde for efficient JSON handling
- **Web Dashboard**: React with modern UI components

## Use Cases

TagCache excels in various scenarios:

### Web Application Caching
- Session storage with automatic expiration
- API response caching with tag-based invalidation
- Database query result caching

### Real-time Analytics
- High-speed counters and metrics collection
- Temporary data aggregation
- Rate limiting and quota management

### Microservices
- Shared cache between services
- Service discovery and configuration
- Cross-service coordination

### High-Performance Applications
- Gaming leaderboards and statistics
- Financial data caching
- IoT data buffering

## Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: 1M+ operations per second (TCP protocol)
- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond average response times
- **Memory**: Efficient memory usage with configurable limits
- **Concurrency**: Scales linearly with CPU cores
